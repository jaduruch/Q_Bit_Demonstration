# Q_Bit Demonstration

Welcome to **Q_Bit Demonstration**—an educational tool designed to visually and interactively explain and showcase the basics of quantum bits (qubits). This repository is a playground for anyone curious about quantum computing and gives both a conceptual and practical grasp of the qubit.

## 🚧 Project Status: Work in Progress

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is **still in progress** and currently very incomplete!  
> I am nowhere near finished, so expect lots of changes and new features as development continues. Feedback and ideas are welcome, but bear with me as I update and build out the content.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Bloch Sphere Visualization:** See qubit states LIVE on the Bloch sphere
- **Basic Quantum Operations:** Try out X, Y, Z, Hadamard, and more gates to understand how they affect qubit states
- **Interactive Controls:** Adjust parameters and watch qubit states rotate, change, and even get entangled!

## 📜 About

The project was inspired by a similar demonstration I encountered at **Quantum Amsterdam**—an amazing collaborative quantum research hub. Their interactive displays motivated me to make this open-source version for the broader community!

## 🧠 What is a Qubit?

A **qubit** is the fundamental building block of quantum computers, behaving in ways classical bits never could. Unlike ordinary bits, qubits can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously through the phenomenon of superposition. Visualizing these states is much easier with the Bloch sphere:
